   Note:-
	  1.Variable is memory space where value is stored.
	  2.Variable either initialized or declared it.
	  3.For Initialization variable we must follow the following syntax.
	     1.Data_type name_of_variable=value;//Initialization of variable.
		 Example:-
			   1.int a=10;
			   2.float b=10.2;
			   3.char c='a';
	     2.Data_type name_of_variable;//declaration of variable.
		 Example:-
			   1.int a;
			   2.float b;
			   3.char c;
	  4.Rule for defining variables are given below.
	      1.It must start with alphabet or underscore(_) symbols.
	      2.It must not contain white space(space).
	      3.Keywords must not used as variable name.
	      4.Variable name can joint with underscore symbol.
	      5.We can joint digit with variable name but digit should not first letter.
	      6.Special symbol is not used between variable name.
