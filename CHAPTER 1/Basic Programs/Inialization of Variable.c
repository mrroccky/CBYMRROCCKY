/*
   Note:-
	  1.Variable is memory space where value is stored.
	  2.Variable either initialized or declared it.
	  3.For defining variable we must follow the following syntax.
	     1.Data_type name_of_variable=value;//Initialization of variable.
		 Example:-
			   1.int a=10;
			   2.float b=10.2;
			   3.char c='a';
	     2.Data_type name_of_variable;//declaration of variable.
		 Example:-
			   1.int a;
			   2.float b;
			   3.char c;
	  4.Rule for defining variables are given below.
	      1.It must start with alphabet or understore(_) symbols.
	      2.It must not contain white space(space).
	      3.Keywords must not used as variable name.
	      4.Variable name can joint with understore symbol.
	      5.We can joint digit with variable name along with variable
		but digit should not first letter.
	      6. Special symbol is not used between variable name.
